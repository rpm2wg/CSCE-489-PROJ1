## Purpose
This simple Linux shell can execute a limited number of commands and accomplish a few tasks.

## Usage

Start the shell from a terminal.  
Available commands are:   

    dir  
    create <filename>  
    update <filename> <number> <"Your text"> <&> - Ampersand is optional  
    list <filename>  
    halt  

Follow the syntax very closely, without the < > of course. Many errors may be caught but not all.  


## Limitations
The shell is limited to the commands above only using the syntax provided.
